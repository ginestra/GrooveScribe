# README

This repo is a fork of [Lou Montulli's GrooveScribe](https://github.com/montulli/GrooveScribe).

My current plan is to rationalise and refactor the code so that it becomes easier to add/edit features.

It's a side project, non-commercial. Collaborators are welcome.
Please be kind and considerate when offering feedback, everyone involved is donating their time to this. :)

The app is running @ https://ginestra.github.io/GrooveScribe/

## How to run the app locally

This app is plain HTML + JS + CSS and it's deployed on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
You can fork or clone the repository and run it locally. Follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) on how to.

**Beginner Tip:** I use the flag `--watch` so that I that I don't have to build at every change.

## What is my plan for this app?

I'd like to contribute to make it easier to maintain and scale.

In particular I will make an attempt at:
* Refactoring CSS - This is my domain
* Refactor JS - This is less my domain
* Adding some docs

Also:

* In collaboration with my drum teacher, I will try to add new features, extend existing ones, and possibly tidy up others

* Ideally, I would like to make the code a bit more modular

Overall GrooveScribe is a sweet app, I started using it as a student and loved it, so I want more people to have access to it.

It will remain available for others to implement their changes and I will be open to pull requests to improve this version of it.

### Licence
The app will remain under GNU Licence as published by its original authours.

## Thanks
Thanks to [Lou Montulli](http://montulli.github.io/GrooveScribe/) and [Mike Johnston](http://www.mikeslessons.com/gscribe/) for creating this wonderful tool and sharing it with the rest of the world.

## Final note
I'll edit this README as I implement this app more.
